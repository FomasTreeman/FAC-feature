Founders and Coders Feature project.
===============	


Planning
--------------
To build this project i knew i had to create the starting page in html with the layout and all necessary elements. From there i can use the DOM manipulation to add or create tortoises and have triggers for events.

Building 
-------------
As building i stumbled across problems such as random speed and determinging a range for the random number generator as so that none were too slow and none were too fast. I also found triggering the winner notification at the right time to be a challenge. 

Debugging 
---------------
Debugging took a lot of brute force attemtps to see if the random number generator for the speed was suitable.s
